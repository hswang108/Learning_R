    "`Recursive partitioning` is a statistical method for multivariable analysis. Recursive partitioning creates a decision tree that strives to correctly classify members of the population by splitting it into sub-populations based on several dichotomous (different) independent variables. The process is termed recursive because each sub-population may in turn be split an indefinite number of times until the splitting process terminates after a particular stopping criterion is reached.\n",

    "In multiple regression, we let there be multiple independent variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is a **global model**, where there is a single predictive formula holding over the entire data-space. When the data has lots of features which interact in complicated, nonlinear ways, assembling a single global model can be very difficult, and hopelessly confusing when you do succeed. An alternative approach to nonlinear regression is to sub-divide, or partition, the space into smaller regions, where the interactions are more manageable. We then partition the sub-divisions again — this is called **recursive partitioning** — until finally we get to chunks of the space which are so tame that we can fit simple models to them. The **global model** thus has two parts: one is just the recursive partition, the other is a simple model for each cell of the partition.\n",

    "Prediction trees use the tree to represent the recursive partition. Each of the\n",
