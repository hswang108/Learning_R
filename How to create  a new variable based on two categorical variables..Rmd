How to create a new variable based on two categorical variables
====

In statistics, a `categorical variable` is a variable that can take on one of a limited, and usually fixed, number of possible values, thus assigning each individual to a particular group or "category."


I have two categorical variables a & b.

```{r}
a = sample(0:1, size=10, replace=T )
b = sample(0:1, size=10, replace=T )
```

I want to create a new variable c, whose values depend on a & b in such a way:

```{r}
c = vector(length=10)
c[a==1 & b==1] = 1
c[a==1 & b==0] = 2
c[a==0 & b==1] = 3
c[a==0 & b==0] = 4
```
