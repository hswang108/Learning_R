How to convert or transform the list
========================================================

Input List 
```{r}
L <- list(A = 25, B = 22, C = 25, D = 26);L
```

Expected Output 

```
$25
[1] "A" "C"

$22
[1] "B"

$26
[1] "D"
```



```{r}
split(names(L), unlist(L))
```


Split - Divide into groups and re-assemble


```{r}
names(L)
```


unlist - flatten lists 
Given a list structure x, unlist simplifies it to produce a vector which contains all the atomic components which occur in x.

```{r}
unlist(L)
```


```{r}
str(unlist(L))
```


TODO
You could also try with(stack(L), split(as.character(ind), values)).
```{r}
with(stack(L), split(as.character(ind), values))
```
